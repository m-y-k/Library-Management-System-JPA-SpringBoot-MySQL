    This is library management system project for backend system design which is built using tech stacks like
    java, springboot, jpa, hibernate orm, mysql.

    There are many APIs written which performs CRUD operations over all the entities. These entities are -
        1. Book
        2. Author
        3. Student
        4. Transaction

    For security reasons, Request DTOs and ResponseDTOs are formed here which restricts
    our data from exposing in front of the Student.

    Various exceptions that can occur while performing CRUD operations are also handled carefully.

    This project has an email sending functionality which sends mail to the Student whenever a book is issued to him.

     ** You just need to clone this project in your IDE and then, you can test its APIs **
